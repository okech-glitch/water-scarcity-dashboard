\section{Introduction}
This report outlines the impact of the AI-powered Water Scarcity Dashboard in Kenya, designed to enhance agricultural resilience and food security.

\section{Impact Metrics}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Current Yield}: 100,000 tonnes, feeding 0.67 million people.
    \item \textbf{Projected Yield (+20\%)}: 120,000 tonnes, feeding 0.80 million people.
    \item \textbf{Projected Yield (+30\%)}: 130,000 tonnes, feeding 0.87 million people.
\end{itemize}

\section{Benefits}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Yield increase of up to 30\% with AI adoption.
    \item Enhanced food security for millions through optimized water use.
    \item Economic savings of 12.5â€“18.75 billion KES in drought losses.
    \item Alignment with SDG 13 (Climate Action), SDG 2 (Zero Hunger), and SDG 6 (Clean Water).
\end{itemize}
